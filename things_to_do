Sections are divided by pipes. 
If I see > in a section, dump everything from stdin into it after program execution. 
If I see multiple of >, execute the right most one first. 

If I see < in a section, loading it as input first
If I see multiple of >, execute the right most one first. 

When do we need an extra pipe:
1) proc1 |b proc2
|b will need to close output for input in proc2 to give EOF

2) proc |a proc2 |b proc3
|a will need to close output for input in proc2 to give EOF
proc2 will taken input from |a and output in |b
|a will need to close input and then a new pipe must be as |a (if needed)
|b will need to close output for input in proc3 to give EOF
|b will need to close input to end the program.
